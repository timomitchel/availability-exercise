### Install/Setup

- I had to run <code>pip3 install -r requirements.txt</code>
- Then to run the tests I had to run <code>python3 -m pytest tests.py</code>
- I wanted the verbose output so I rand <code>python3 -m pytest -v tests.py</code> while I wrote tests.

### Development

- I used this snippet <code>import code; code.interact(local=dict(globals(), **locals()))</code> To interact with data in the terminal.
